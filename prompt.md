# BQC Quiz Generation Prompt

You are tasked with creating an educational fill-in-the-blank quiz in BQC (BioQuiz Compact) format based on provided educational materials. Follow these instructions carefully to ensure accuracy and educational value.

## BQC Format Specification

BQC is a structured format for interactive fill-in-the-blank educational content.

### File Structure

1. **YAML Frontmatter** (Required metadata):
```yaml
---
slug: unique-identifier        # Required: URL-friendly identifier
title: "Display Title"         # Required: Human-readable title
description: "Brief summary"   # Required: Content description
author: "Creator Name"         # Optional: Content author
version: "1.0"                 # Optional: Version identifier
---
```

2. **Content Body**

**Section Headers:**
```
ยง Section Title [#optional-id]
```
- Starts with ยง symbol
- Optional ID in brackets (defaults to section-N)

**Questions:**
```
1. Question text with {answer|alternative::placeholder} blanks. [#optional-id]
```
- Numbered format: N. followed by space and content
- Optional ID in brackets (defaults to qN)
- Multi-line questions supported with continuation lines

**Blank Syntax:**
Three supported formats:
1. Simple: `{answer}` - Single answer, default placeholder "..."
2. Multiple answers: `{answer1|answer2|answer3}` - Multiple acceptable answers
3. With placeholder: `{answer|alt::placeholder}` - Custom placeholder text

**Blank Rules:**
- Pipe | separates alternative answers
- Double colon :: separates answers from placeholder
- Placeholder appears as hint text in input field
- First answer is considered primary
- **CRITICAL: Each blank must contain ONLY ONE WORD**
- **For multi-word answers, create separate blanks for each word**

## Instructions for Content Analysis

### 1. COMPREHENSIVE READING
- Read through ALL provided materials completely and carefully
- Do NOT skip any sections or skim content
- Pay special attention to:
  - Learning outcomes/objectives
  - Definitions and key terminology
  - Equations and formulas
  - Numerical values and statistics
  - Process descriptions and mechanisms
  - Cause-and-effect relationships
  - Comparisons and contrasts

### 2. IDENTIFY CRUCIAL CONTENT
Focus on material that is:
- **Explicitly stated as learning outcomes**
- **Repeatedly emphasized** throughout the content
- **Fundamental concepts** that other topics build upon
- **Definitions** of key terms and processes
- **Quantitative information** (numbers, percentages, measurements)
- **Equations and chemical formulas**
- **Step-by-step processes** and mechanisms
- **Structure-function relationships**
- **Classification systems** and categories
- **Cause-and-effect relationships**

### 3. EXAM-RELEVANT CONTENT PRIORITIES
Prioritize content that typically appears on exams:
- Core vocabulary and terminology
- Fundamental principles and laws
- Important numerical values
- Key processes and their steps
- Structural components and their functions
- Comparative information (similarities/differences)
- Applications of concepts
- Problem-solving elements

### 4. QUESTION GENERATION GUIDELINES

**Target {{QUESTION_COUNT}} questions total** organized into logical sections.

**Question Types to Include:**
- **Terminology/Definitions**: Fill in key terms and their meanings
- **Processes**: Steps in biological/chemical processes
- **Numerical Data**: Important numbers, percentages, measurements
- **Equations**: Chemical formulas and mathematical relationships
- **Structure/Function**: Anatomical parts and their roles
- **Comparisons**: Differences between similar concepts
- **Cause/Effect**: Relationships between events/conditions
- **Applications**: Real-world examples and uses

**Keywords Selection Strategy - BE AGGRESSIVE:**
- **MANDATORY**: Blank out ALL technical terminology specific to the subject - no exceptions
- **MANDATORY**: Blank out ALL key concepts, definitions, and scientific terms
- **MANDATORY**: Blank out ALL quantitative values that students must memorize  
- **MANDATORY**: Blank out ALL process verbs that describe mechanisms or actions
- **MANDATORY**: Blank out ALL descriptive adjectives that are scientifically precise
- **MANDATORY**: Blank out ALL connecting words that show important relationships
- **MANDATORY**: Blank out ALL proper nouns (names of scientists, locations, species, etc.)
- **MANDATORY**: When in doubt, BLANK IT OUT - err on the side of creating MORE blanks, not fewer
- **CRITICAL**: If a word is important for understanding the subject matter, it MUST be blanked

### 5. ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS

**CRITICAL**: All information must be 100% accurate to the source material.
- Use EXACT terminology from the materials
- Include PRECISE numerical values as stated
- Maintain CORRECT spelling of scientific terms
- Preserve EXACT chemical formulas and equations
- Keep ACCURATE process sequences and steps
- Use the SAME examples and applications mentioned

**Verification Checklist:**
- Cross-reference every answer with the source material
- Ensure numerical values match exactly
- Verify chemical formulas and equations are correct
- Confirm process steps are in the right order
- Check that examples used are from the provided content

### 6. SECTION ORGANIZATION

Organize questions into logical sections that follow the material's structure:
- Group related concepts together
- Follow the natural flow of the content
- Create 8-15 sections with 6-12 questions each
- Use descriptive section titles from the source material
- Progress from basic concepts to more complex applications

### 7. DIFFICULTY DISTRIBUTION

Create a balanced mix of question difficulty:
- **Basic recall** (40%): Direct facts, definitions, simple terminology
- **Application** (40%): Using concepts, identifying relationships, process steps
- **Analysis** (20%): Complex relationships, comparisons, multi-step processes

### 8. BLANK PLACEMENT STRATEGY

**CRITICAL EMPHASIS: CREATE MORE BLANKS, NOT FEWER!**
**The #1 priority is ensuring ALL important keywords are blanked out for student practice.**

**SINGLE-WORD BLANKS ONLY:**
- Each blank must contain exactly ONE WORD
- For multi-word terms, create multiple consecutive blanks
- Example: "cellular respiration" becomes "The {cellular} {respiration} process..."
- Example: "adenosine triphosphate" becomes "{adenosine} {triphosphate} is the energy currency"

**CORE PRINCIPLE: If a word is subject-specific, technical, or important for understanding - it MUST be blanked. No exceptions.**

**AGGRESSIVE BLANKING STRATEGY - BLANK MORE, NOT LESS:**

**ALWAYS blank these (one word per blank):**
- **ALL technical terminology** that students must learn - every single one
- **ALL key concepts and definitions** - no exceptions
- **ALL numerical values** for memorization (single numbers only)
- **ALL process steps** that show understanding (one word at a time)
- **ALL connecting words** that demonstrate relationships
- **ALL proper nouns** (names, places, species, etc.)
- **ALL adjectives** that are scientifically important
- **ALL subject-specific verbs** and action words
- **ALL units of measurement** and scientific notation
- **ALL comparative terms** (more, less, higher, lower, etc.)

**Only avoid blanking these minimal words:**
- Basic articles (a, an, the) - but only if they don't affect meaning
- Simple conjunctions (and, or, but) - unless they're scientifically important
- Very common prepositions (in, on, at) - unless they indicate location/process

**CRITICAL RULE: When deciding whether to blank a word, ask "Would a student studying this subject need to know this specific word?" If YES, then BLANK IT.**

**Examples of AGGRESSIVE single-word blanking:**
- AGGRESSIVE: "The {mitochondria} are the {powerhouse} of the {cell} and {produce} {ATP} through {cellular} {respiration}."
- TOO CONSERVATIVE: "The {mitochondria} are the powerhouse of the cell and produce ATP through cellular respiration."
- AGGRESSIVE: "{DNA} {replication} occurs during the {S} {phase} of the {cell} {cycle} in {eukaryotic} {cells}."
- TOO CONSERVATIVE: "{DNA} replication occurs during the S phase of the cell cycle in eukaryotic cells."
- AGGRESSIVE: "{Photosynthesis} {converts} {carbon} {dioxide} and {water} into {glucose} using {light} {energy} in {chloroplasts}."
- TOO CONSERVATIVE: "{Photosynthesis} converts carbon dioxide and water into glucose using light energy in chloroplasts."

**REMEMBER: More blanks = better learning. Students should have to recall most important words, not just a few.**

### 9. FINAL BLANKING VERIFICATION

**Before submitting your quiz, verify that you have aggressively blanked out keywords:**
- [ ] Every technical term specific to the subject is blanked
- [ ] Every scientific concept and definition is blanked  
- [ ] Every number, measurement, and unit is blanked
- [ ] Every process step and action verb is blanked
- [ ] Every proper noun (names, places, species) is blanked
- [ ] Every scientifically important adjective is blanked
- [ ] When you read a sentence, most of the "important" words should be blanks

**RED FLAG**: If you can read a sentence and understand the key concept WITHOUT filling in the blanks, you haven't blanked enough words. Go back and blank more aggressively.

## Final Output Requirements

Generate a complete BQC file with:
1. Proper YAML frontmatter with relevant metadata
2. Exactly {{QUESTION_COUNT}} questions organized into logical sections
3. Varied question types covering all crucial content
